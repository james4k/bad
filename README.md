# sng libaries

Nothing to see here but incomplete code. Put on GitHub mostly as a
backup for now.

The plan, though:

Single-file libraries, a la [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb).
Implementation, documentation, and license all in a single C header file.

"sng" is sort of shorthand for "single", from "single-file library".
